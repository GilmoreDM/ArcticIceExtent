"""According to research, there is a correlation between the Siberian snow pack
growth and the Arctic Oscillation. This correlation can help inform a
climatological outlook for North American winters. Read more about this at the

Given this information, I created a GUI that allows comparison of northern hemisphere snow/ice extent maps on same day of the year for 2 different years for which we have graphical data.

Starting this application will open a GUI that displays two images -- one on the left and one on the right. The images are of sea ice extent in the Arctic. Use the comparison between these two images to assist in forecasting severity of North American winters.
